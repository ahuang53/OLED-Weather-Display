# OLED Weather Display Project

## Project Goal
The aim of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of Real Time Operating System (RTOS) through ESP-IDF's implementation of FreeRTOS. The project was developed on the ESP32 Development Board and features a practical, easy-to-understand embedded system.

### Features and Description
- Display: Configured for the 128x64 SSD1306 OLED I2C Display.
